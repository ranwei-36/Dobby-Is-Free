We were all heartbroken by how Dobby’s story ended in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, so we decided to rewrite the fate of this kind, brave, and lovable house elf. In this adventure engine, you get to give Dobby a new life.
We’ve designed four unique paths filled with exciting choices for Dobby, and it’s up to you, our user, to decide his ending. To help you navigate, all choices are represented by icons and marked with notations on the map above. As you interact with the text, Dobby will follow the path you choose.
We hope you enjoy the journey with Dobby!
