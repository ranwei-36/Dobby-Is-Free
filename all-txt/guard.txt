Dobby charms a few old garden tools to create cheerful scarecrows with animated faces that hum soft lullabies when approached. 
The scarecrows gently guide misbehaving gnomes back to their nooks by extending glowing broom arms or lighting up their friendly faces with a wink. 
The gnomes initially try to outwit the scarecrows but quickly grow to find them amusing, treating them like playful guardians.

Over time, the garden becomes a balanced harmony. 
The Weasleys are delighted by how Dobbyâ€™s scarecrows not only keep the garden in order but also add a whimsical charm to their home. 
Molly Weasley even knits tiny scarves for the scarecrows, which the gnomes help to arrange as decorations.
