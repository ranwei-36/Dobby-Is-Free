Dobby waves his hands, summoning magical bubbles that surround the cursed wizard. 
The bubbles gently absorb the chaotic energy, glowing brightly as they stabilize the wizard’s curse. 
As Dobby focuses, a stray bubble floats toward a healer and pops in their face, showering them with glitter. 

The room is calm now, and Dobby proudly finishes his work, the wizard now fully healed.

Now sitting upright and free from the curse’s grip, the wizard stares at Dobby with gratitude and relief. 
“I—I feel normal again. Thank you, Dobby. I thought it would never end.” 

Dobby grins, his ears twitching happily. “It is Dobby’s pleasure to help, sir! This is why Dobby loves working!”
