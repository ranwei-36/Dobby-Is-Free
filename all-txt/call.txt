Dobby calls out, “Dobby needs help, kind witches and wizards!” Two healers rush over, ready to assist. 
One healer casts a calming charm to still the chaotic energy around the wizard, while another uses a focused healing spell. 
Dobby joins in, channeling his unique house-elf magic to stabilize the curse.

Together, they work in harmony, and the curse slowly fades. 
The wizard’s condition improves, and the room finally settles. 
One healer slips on a potion spill but laughs it off. “A little messy, but it worked!” they say. 

Now sitting upright and free from the curse’s grip, the wizard stares at Dobby with gratitude and relief. 
“I—I feel normal again. Thank you, Dobby. I thought it would never end.” 

Dobby grins, his ears twitching happily. “It is Dobby’s pleasure to help, sir! This is why Dobby loves working!”
