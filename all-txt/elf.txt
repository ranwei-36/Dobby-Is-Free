The ribbons float gently in the air, swaying as if carried by a soft breeze. 
One by one, they dissolve into nothingness, leaving behind a faint, musical chime that echoes like wind through enchanted bells. 
The room feels lighter and warmer with every ribbon that disappears, as though Dobby’s magic is not just removing the curse but replacing it with hope and serenity.

The wizard, previously trembling and overwhelmed, begins to relax as the curse unwinds from their body. 
Their breathing steadies, and the frantic sparks fade from their fingertips. 
Dobby looks up at them, smiling brightly. “There, sir! Dobby has removed the bad magic. You is all better now!”

The healers stand in awe, marveling at the elegance and effectiveness of Dobby’s magic. 
One murmurs, “I’ve never seen anything like that—house-elf magic is truly extraordinary.”
