Dobby carefully demonstrates how to bow and earn the hippogriff's trust. 
The majestic leader steps forward, allowing Dobby to climb onto its back.

“Who would like to try?” Dobby calls out.

The bravest wizard, Rick Wash, steps forward and mirrors Dobby’s bowing technique. 
With some nervous laughter and encouragement, Rick manages to ride the hippogriff, soaring gently above the meadow. 

The group cheers. What an unforgettable moment!
