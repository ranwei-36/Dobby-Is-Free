Over the years, impressed by his dedication and growing expertise, the healers offer Dobby a permanent position at Hogwarts’ infirmary. 
There, he assists Madam Pomfrey in tending to students, his love for his job shining through in every spell he casts and every smile he gives.

Years later, the Ministry of Magic recognizes Dobby’s contributions to magical healthcare and appoints him as the Head of Magical Creature Healthcare at St. Mungo’s. 
He ensures that all beings, magical or otherwise, receive the care they deserve.

In the hospital’s main hall, a plaque commemorates Dobby’s legacy:
"Dobby, a free elf and healer extraordinaire, whose love for his work and quick thinking saved countless lives."
