As they moved further into the forest, the group stumbled upon a trail lined with soft silver hoofprints. 
Dobby’s ears perked up.
“Unicorns, this way!” he whispered, motioning for everyone to tread lightly.

The group found a meadow glowing softly under sunlight filtering through the trees. 
A unicorn stood at its center, its coat shimmering like pure moonlight. The group froze in awe.
Suddenly, a squirrel darted through the underbrush, startling the unicorn into stepping back cautiously.

The group looked to Dobby for guidance.
Dobby enchanted a nearby patch of flowers to bloom rapidly. 
The unicorn, intrigued and reassured, stepped forward to investigate.

Now that the unicorn seemed calmer, what should the group do?
