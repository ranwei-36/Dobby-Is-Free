Dobby darts to a nearby shelf, he spots a small, shimmering crystal. 
The crystal is faceted, catching the light like a tiny, enchanted prism. 

“Dobby knows what to do!” he clutches the crystal tightly and hurries back to the cursed wizard.

The wizard trembles as chaotic sparks of magic continue to flare unpredictably from their body. 
Dobby places the crystal carefully near the wizard’s chest, its smooth surface beginning to glow the moment it makes contact.

“Stay still, sir. Dobby is helping now,” he says reassuringly, his hands hovering over the crystal.
 
It begins to draw the chaotic energy toward itself like a magnet, absorbing the sparks and ripples of unstable magic that had plagued the wizard. 
The wild sparks that had been shooting across the ward begin to die down. 

The wizard lets out a shaky breath, his body visibly relaxing as the chaos subsides.

Now sitting upright and free from the curse’s grip, he stares at Dobby with gratitude and relief. 
“I—I feel normal again. Thank you, Dobby. I thought it would never end.” 

Dobby grins, his ears twitching happily. “It is Dobby’s pleasure to help, sir! This is why Dobby loves working!”
