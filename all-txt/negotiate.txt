Dobby approaches the gnome leader, who wears a tiny leaf hat and waves his twig sign proudly.
“Dobby understands gnome struggles,” Dobby says, bowing respectfully. “But gardens must also stay nice for wizards!”

The leader squints at Dobby but agrees to talk. 
After a lengthy discussion (and a few bribes in the form of shiny buttons and enchanted biscuits), Dobby proposes a compromise:

1. Softer landing spots for evictions will be provided.
2. Eviction spins will be limited to three rotations.
3. The Weasleys will allow the gnomes to keep one bush as their designated “safe zone.”

The gnomes cheer at the fair treatment, dismantling their protest signs.
