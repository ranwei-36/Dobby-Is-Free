Dobby’s heart races as the goblin guards charge toward them, but he remains calm, focusing on the space around him. 
With a snap of his fingers, the air around them shimmers. 

Dobby’s magic swirls into a glowing, swirling vortex of light, its edges crackling with energy. 
He grabs Grimble’s hand, and in an instant, the world around them warps into a whirlwind of glittering colors.

They feel a sharp tug as the magic pulls them through space, the vault and the goblins fading into a blur. 
The next moment, they reappear just outside the Gringotts vaults, their feet landing softly on the cobblestones.
