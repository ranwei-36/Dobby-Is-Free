Dobby prioritizes the wizard, ignoring the chaos around him. 
He takes the patient’s hand and channeling his magic. 
The curse begins to stabilize, but the surrounding chaos continues unchecked. 
Nearby potion bottles fall off a shelf, and a healer slips on the spilled liquid, landing in a pile of glittering sparks.

“Watch out!” one healer calls, but it’s too late. 
Another healer hurries toward the scene, stepping directly onto the slippery potion. 
His feet fly out from under them, and he lands unceremoniously in a pile of glittering sparks. 

Now covered in blue goo and sparkling like a living Christmas ornament, the healer groans.

“Really, Dobby?”

What should Dobby do next to turn the situation around?
