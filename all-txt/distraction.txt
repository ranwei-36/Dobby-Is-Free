Dobby waves his hand and conjures a series of magical illusions.
A floating golden key, shimmering butterflies, and a spinning cauldron of bright sparks. 
The goblin guards charge toward the golden key, confused by the distractions. 
One even slips and falls into the cauldron’s magical spark shower, while another is distracted by a sudden puff of smoke. 

Grimble quickly grabs the chest, his heart racing. 

With Dobby’s magic causing chaos around the room, he’s able to slip out unnoticed, just as the goblins realize they’ve been tricked.

As Grimble hurries to the vault door, he motions for Dobby to follow. 
Together, they make their way out of the vault, barely avoiding the guards, who are still scrambling in confusion.
