Dobby gathers the gnomes in a small circle and uses his magic to create tiny tools that fit perfectly in their hands. 
“Gnomes will help the garden grow! Dobby shows how!” he guides them through simple tasks like weeding and watering.

The mischievous gnomes, initially skeptical, quickly warm up to the idea of being involved in the garden’s upkeep. 
They take pride in their newfound purpose, turning tasks into games and racing to see who can pull the most weeds. 
The garden flourishes under their care, and the Weasleys watch in amazement as their mischievous pests transform into enthusiastic helpers.
