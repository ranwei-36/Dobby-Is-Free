Deeper in the forest, Dobby spots faint hoofprints that can only belong to thestrals. 
“Ah, thestrals!” Dobby whispers. “Gentle creatures, but not everyone can see them.”
As the group follows the tracks, a rustling sound spooks them. 
A wizard accidentally steps on a branch, startling a thestral, which begins to take flight. 
Dobby gently calms it by offering an apple and whispering soothing words, earning the trust of the shy creature. 
Those who can see the thestral are awed, while others feel its presence through a soft, mysterious breeze.
