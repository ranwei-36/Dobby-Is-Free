After earning his freedom, Dobby discovered his favorite thing in the world—having a job and getting paid! 
He loved the feeling of being useful and valued, and his natural talent for helping others made him gravitate toward a career in healing. 
Remembering the challenges he had overcome, Dobby decided to help those in need, whether house-elves, magical beings, or wizards.

Dobby began his internship at St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. 
His unique house-elf magic and enthusiasm for employment made him an instant hit. 

One day, a wizard cursed by a powerful and chaotic spell was rushed into the hospital. 
Sparks flew from the wizard’s fingertips, causing nearby objects to float and explode in showers of light. 
The healers were overwhelmed, unable to contain the dangerous magic. 
Dobby, eager to help, stepped forward, but he had to decide carefully what to do.
