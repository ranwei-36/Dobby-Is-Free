Dobby decides to help the goblin, Grimble, who is stuck in a magical vault deep within Gringotts.
As they sneak into the bank under the cover of night, they must navigate some enchanted traps.

The first room they enter has a giant, jewel-encrusted door labeled “Authorized Personnel Only: Intruders Beware!” 
Grimble hesitates, “Dobby, are you sure about this? The traps in here are dangerous!”

Dobby answers, “Dobby will try his best! No trap can stop a free elf!” 

As they push open the heavy door, they are greeted by an enormous dragon chained to the far wall. 
However, this is no ordinary dragon. Its nostrils sparkle ominously.

Grimble points at a lever on the wall labeled “Glitter Suppressant. Use only in emergencies.”
“Quick, Dobby! We need to decide fast!”
