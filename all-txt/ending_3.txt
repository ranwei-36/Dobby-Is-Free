“We made it!” Grimble exclaims, holding up his treasure. 
The familiar sights of Diagon Alley greet them, and the loud commotion of goblin guards chasing after them slowly fades into the distance.

“I can’t believe we did it! You were brilliant, Dobby.”

Grimble smiles warmly and hands Dobby a pouch of galleons.
“Take this, Dobby. You deserve it. Enough gold to buy anything you’ve ever dreamed of.”
-
With the pouch of galleons Grimble gave him, Dobby opened a bakery called “Dobby’s Delightful Delicacies” in Hogsmead. 

Decades later, on his first visit to Hogsmeade, Albus Severus Potter stepped into Dobby’s bakery. 
Awed by the sparkling display of magical treats, Albus pointed to the famous Pain au Chocolat.

Dobby, now a beloved figure in the village, handed it to him with a warm smile. “This one is full of happiness, young master,” he said.

Albus took a bite, his face lighting up with joy. “It’s amazing!”

Dobby beamed, proud that his creations continued to bring happiness to the next generation of witches and wizards.
