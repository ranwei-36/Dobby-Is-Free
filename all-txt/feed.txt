Dobby pulls out a pouch of enchanted snacks, tossing them toward the hippogriffs. 

The treats glitter faintly as they land, catching the attention of the herd. 
The hippogriffs approach with interest, pecking at the snacks while ruffling their feathers contentedly.

The group gathers closer as Dobby gently strokes the leaderâ€™s neck. 
The herd, now completely at ease, even allows the group to touch their soft, gleaming feathers. 

A young wizard gasps, holding a shed feather, a magical keepsake of their encounter.
