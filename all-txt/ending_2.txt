Dobby’s tours continued to grow in popularity, with stories of his respectful interactions with magical creatures spreading far and wide. 
Wizards and witches eagerly signed up for his safaris, which always promised adventure, wonder, and a deep respect for the magical world.

Years later, Dobby partnered with Rubeus Hagrid to open a magical creature sanctuary near the Forbidden Forest. 
Together, they created a haven for creatures and a place for wizards to learn and connect with the magical world.

One evening, as they sat by a fire outside Hagrid’s hut, Dobby turned to his friend.
“Dobby is the happiest elf,” he said softly, “and friends like Hagrid make everything magical.”
