The group stumbles upon a grazing herd of hippogriffs.
A majestic leader, silver-feathered and proud, eyes the group cautiously.

“Hippogriffs are very proud,” Dobby whispers. “Wizards must bow and wait for their permission before approaching!”

One nervous wizard hesitates, shuffling nervously, causing the leader to squawk in alarm and spread its wings. 
The herd begins to stir uneasily.

Dobby steps in immediately, bowing so low his nose nearly touches the ground. 
After a tense moment, the hippogriff leader bows back, and the herd relaxes, allowing the group to marvel at their beauty.

Dobby decides to enhance the group's experience.
