When Dobby pulls the lever, the Glitter Dragon lets out one final harmless sneeze, sending a sparkling pink cloud into the air. 
The dragon snorts, then curls up peacefully, its glittery glow dimming as it falls into a deep slumber.

“Dobby did it!” the elf cheers, brushing glitter off his ears. Grimble looks around nervously.
“Let’s grab the treasure and get out of here before something else wakes up!”

The vault door swings open with a low rumble, revealing Grimble’s long-lost family treasure. 
Inside is a golden chest filled with goblin-made artifacts, ancient coins, and precious gemstones. 
Grimble’s eyes widen as he retrieves a small, intricately carved stone.
“This is it,” he whispers. “My family’s legacy. Dobby, you’ve done more than I could’ve hoped.”

Suddenly, alarms echo through the vault. 
The enchanted goblin portraits on the walls come to life, shouting, “INTRUDERS! SEIZE THEM!” 
The glittery dragon stirs, its nostrils flaring as it snorts a sleepy puff of shimmering smoke.

Grimble grabs Dobby’s hand. “We’ve got to go—NOW!”
