After earning his freedom and exploring the wizarding world, Dobby discovered a passion for magical creatures. 
With his boundless enthusiasm and natural gift for understanding creatures, he started his own business: Dobby’s Enchanted Safaris. 
Wizards from all over the world flocked to join his tours, which promised breathtaking encounters with unicorns, hippogriffs, and even the elusive thestrals—all in their natural habitats.

On one bright morning, Dobby gathered a group of eager wizards in the Forbidden Forest.
“Welcome to Dobby’s Enchanted Safari! Dobby promises a magical and SAFE adventure!” he said, his ears flopping with excitement.

The tour began smoothly, but soon Dobby faced an unexpected situation, and now the adventurers had to make a choice.
